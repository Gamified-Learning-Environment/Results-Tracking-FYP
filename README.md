# FYP - Results Tracking Repository
This is the repository for Results Tracking and Data Storage for my Gamified Learning Environemnt. This is responsible for logging quiz results, tracking scores, and monitoring student progress.

### Contains: 
Score calculation, result storage, and progress analysis.
### Technologies: 
Python (Flask/FastAPI), MongoDB (for storing results and tracking progress).

### Project Proposal Excerpt: 
Dynamic Feedback and Personalization – Firstly, provide feedback based on quiz answers, 
recommend other quizzes a student could take or suggest study material based on performance, 
secondly, I’d love to have the system shift its quiz difficulty based on a student’s performance as 
well.
