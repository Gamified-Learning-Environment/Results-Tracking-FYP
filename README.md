# FYP - Results Tracking Repository
This is the repository for Results Tracking and Data Storage for my Gamified Learning Environemnt. This is responsible for logging quiz results, tracking scores, and monitoring student progress. See the Frontend and the Project Dissertation for greater details.

### Contains: 
Score calculation, result storage, and progress analysis.
### Technologies: 
Python (Flask/FastAPI), MongoDB (for storing results and tracking progress).


## Deployment and Running
While you could download, compile and run each of the repositories for this Final Year Project and get a more in depth look into the code, it is also fully deployed on Railway at the following link : https://exper-frontend-production.up.railway.app

Alternatively, here's a QR Code:

### Prerequisites
Node.js (v18+) and npm/yarn
Python (v3.9+)
MongoDB database
API keys for:
OpenAI

Google Gemini (optional)

### Setup and Installation
1. Clone each repository for this project.
2. For each microservice repeat these steps
      1. 
         ```
         cd service-directory  # e.g., Quiz-Generation-FYP
         python -m venv venv
         source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
         pip install -r requirements.txt
         ```
         
      2. Environmental Variables
         Create a .env file in each microservice directory with appropriate values:
         ```
            MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/quizdb
            OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
            ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key  # Optional
            GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_key  # Optional
         ```
         User Management Service
         ```
         MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/userdb
         JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
         ```

         Results Tracking Service
         ```
         MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/resultsdb
         ```
         Gamification Service
         ```
         MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/gamificationdb
         ```

3. Frontend Setup
      ```
      cd Exper-Frontend/experfrontend
      npm install
      ```
      Create a .env.local file with:
      ```
      NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8080
      NEXT_PUBLIC_QUIZ_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:9090
      NEXT_PUBLIC_RESULTS_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8081
      NEXT_PUBLIC_GAMIFICATION_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8082
      ```

4. Running the Application
   1. Start the microservices, run each in a seperate terminal:
      ```
      # Quiz Generation Service
      cd Quiz-Generation-FYP
      source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
      python app.py  # Will run on port 9090
      
      # User Management Service
      cd User-Management-Service
      source venv/bin/activate
      python app.py  # Will run on port 8080
      
      # Results Tracking Service
      cd Results-Tracking-FYP
      source venv/bin/activate
      python app.py  # Will run on port 8081
      
      # Gamification Service
      cd Gamification-FYP
      source venv/bin/activate
      python app.py  # Will run on port 8082
      ```
   2. Start the Frontend
      ```
      cd Exper-Frontend/experfrontend
      npm run dev
      ```
   Visit http://localhost:3000 to access the application.
